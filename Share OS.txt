### **1. Topic / Name of the Code**

**Topic:** *Process Creation using `fork()` in Linux (System Programming)*
**Name:** *Basic Fork System Call Example*

---

### **2. Explanation of the Topic (in simple words)**

**What is `fork()`?**

* `fork()` is a **system call** in Linux used to **create a new process**.
* When you use `fork()`, your program splits into **two processes**:

  * **Parent Process** (original one)
  * **Child Process** (new one created by `fork()`)

**How does it work?**

* After `fork()`, **both processes continue running** from the next line of code.
* `fork()` returns:

  * `0` to the **child process**
  * a **positive number** (child’s PID) to the **parent process**
  * `-1` if the **fork fails**

So, this code helps you **observe how Linux handles process creation**. Both the child and parent print the same message, but you can distinguish them by the printed `pid`.

### **3. Code Check for Kali Linux Compatibility**

Here’s your **corrected and verified code**, 100% ready to run in Kali Linux:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t p = fork();  // Creates a new process

    if (p < 0) {
        printf("Fork failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Hello world, process_id(pid) = %d\n", getpid());

    return 0;
}
```

**How to Compile and Run in Kali Linux Terminal:**

```bash
gcc fork_example.c -o fork_example
./fork_example
```

**Expected Output (two lines):**

```
Hello world, process_id(pid) = 12345
Hello world, process_id(pid) = 12346
```

(Note: The PIDs will be different each time.)

### **1. Topic / Name of the Code**

**Topic:** *Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm (Non-Preemptive)*
**Name:** *SJF CPU Scheduling in C*

---

### **2. Explanation of the Topic (in simple words)**

**What is SJF Scheduling?**

* It’s a **CPU scheduling algorithm** used by operating systems.
* **Shortest Job First** means the CPU will execute the process with the **smallest burst time (execution time)** first.
* This approach reduces the **average waiting time** and is **non-preemptive** (once a process starts, it runs until it finishes).

**How does this code work?**

1. You input the **number of processes** and their **burst times**.
2. The program **sorts** the processes by burst time.
3. It calculates:

   * **Waiting Time (WT)** = How long a process waits before it starts.
   * **Turnaround Time (TAT)** = Waiting Time + Burst Time.
4. It prints a chart of all values and calculates **average WT and TAT**.

---

### **3. Code Verification for Kali Linux**

Yes, your code is **fully correct and will run perfectly** in Kali Linux.
Here is the **clean version** you can directly copy, compile, and run:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int A[100][4];
    int i, j, n, total = 0, index, temp;
    float avg_wt, avg_tat;

    printf("Enter number of process: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Enter Burst Time:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("P%d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &A[i][1]);
        A[i][0] = i + 1; // Process ID
    }

    // Sorting by Burst Time
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        index = i;
        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (A[j][1] < A[index][1])
                index = j;
        }
        // Swap Burst Time
        temp = A[i][1];
        A[i][1] = A[index][1];
        A[index][1] = temp;

        // Swap Process ID
        temp = A[i][0];
        A[i][0] = A[index][0];
        A[index][0] = temp;
    }

    A[0][2] = 0; // First process waiting time = 0

    // Waiting Time Calculation
    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        A[i][2] = 0;
        for (j = 0; j < i; j++)
            A[i][2] += A[j][1];
        total += A[i][2];
    }

    avg_wt = (float)total / n;
    total = 0;

    printf("P     BT     WT     TAT\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        A[i][3] = A[i][1] + A[i][2]; // TAT = BT + WT
        total += A[i][3];
        printf("P%d     %d     %d      %d\n", A[i][0], A[i][1], A[i][2], A[i][3]);
    }

    avg_tat = (float)total / n;
    printf("Average Waiting Time = %f\n", avg_wt);
    printf("Average Turnaround Time = %f\n", avg_tat);

    return 0;
}

### **1. Topic / Name of the Code**

**Topic:** *Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm*
**Name:** *Round Robin Scheduling in C (with Arrival Time)*

---

### **2. Explanation of the Topic (in simple words)**

**What is Round Robin (RR) Scheduling?**

* It is a **preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm** used by operating systems.
* Each process gets a **fixed time slot** (called *time quantum*) to execute.
* If a process doesn’t finish within that time, it’s **paused and moved to the back of the queue**, and the CPU switches to the next one.
* This continues in a **circular** (round-robin) manner until all processes are done.
* It is **fair** and useful in **time-sharing systems**.

**How this code works:**

1. You enter the **number of processes**, and for each, its **arrival time** and **burst time**.
2. You also input a **time quantum**, which is the maximum time a process can run at once.
3. The program simulates Round Robin scheduling:

   * Processes are picked based on arrival time and executed in rounds.
   * Waiting Time (WT) and Turnaround Time (TAT) are calculated.
4. It prints:

   * Process number
   * Burst time
   * Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
   * Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
5. It calculates and shows the **average WT and TAT**.

### **3. Code Verification for Kali Linux**

The **logic is correct**, but there are a few **small errors in the code** that may cause issues when you compile it in GCC on Kali Linux.

Here is the **corrected version** you can copy, paste, compile, and run directly:

### **Corrected Code:**

    }

    printf("Enter the Time Quantum for the process: ");
    scanf("%d", &quant);

    printf("\nProcess No\tBurst Time\tTAT\t\tWaiting Time");

    for (sum = 0, i = 0; y != 0;) {
        if (temp[i] <= quant && temp[i] > 0) {
            sum += temp[i];
            temp[i] = 0;
            count = 1;
        } else if (temp[i] > 0) {
            temp[i] -= quant;
            sum += quant;
        }

        if (temp[i] == 0 && count == 1) {
            y--;
            printf("\nProcess[%d]\t%d\t\t%d\t\t%d", i + 1, bt[i], sum - at[i], sum - at[i] - bt[i]);
            wt += sum - at[i] - bt[i];
            tat += sum - at[i];
            count = 0;
        }

        if (i == NOP - 1)
            i = 0;

### **1. Topic / Name of the Code**

**Topic:** *Producer-Consumer Problem using Threads in C*
**Name:** *Multithreaded Bounded Buffer (Producer-Consumer) using pthreads*

---

### **2. Explanation of the Topic (in Simple Words)**

**What is the Producer-Consumer Problem?**
It is a classic **multi-threading synchronization problem** where:

* The **Producer** creates data (items) and puts them into a **buffer**.
* The **Consumer** takes items out of the buffer and processes them.
* The buffer has **limited size**, so:

  * Producer must wait if the buffer is full.
  * Consumer must wait if the buffer is empty.
* This requires **thread synchronization** using **mutexes and condition variables** to avoid race conditions.

---

**What your code does:**

* It creates a **fixed-size buffer** (size = 5).
* It uses two threads: one producer and one consumer.
* **Producer**:

  * Produces up to 5 items.
  * Waits if the buffer is full.
* **Consumer**:

  * Consumes up to 5 items.
  * Waits if the buffer is empty.
* Uses:

  * `pthread_mutex_t` to lock/unlock the buffer.
  * `pthread_cond_t` to signal when buffer is full or empty.

---

### **3. Code Verification (for Kali Linux Terminal)**

Your code is **almost correct**, but:

* You missed `\n` in `printf()` statements, so outputs may not appear properly.
* Optional: include headers properly and handle thread creation errors.

### **1. Topic / Name of the Code**

**Topic:** *Banker's Algorithm in Operating System*
**Name:** *Deadlock Avoidance using Banker's Algorithm*

---

### **2. Explanation of the Topic (in Simple Words)**

#### 💡 **What is the Banker's Algorithm?**

The Banker's Algorithm is a **deadlock avoidance** method used in operating systems. It ensures the system always stays in a **safe state** by only granting resource requests if doing so will still allow every process to finish eventually.

---

#### 🧠 **How does it work?**

* You have:

  * A set of **processes** (e.g., P0 to P4).
  * A set of **resources** (e.g., A, B, C).
* Each process has:

  * **Maximum need** (maximum resources it may request).
  * **Allocated resources** (resources it currently holds).
  * **Need** = Max - Allocated.
* The system has some **available** resources.
* The algorithm checks if there's a **sequence** of processes such that all can finish **one by one** by getting their needed resources, releasing them back, and making them available to others.

If such a sequence exists, it is a **safe sequence**, and the system is safe.

### **3. Code Verification (for Kali Linux Terminal)**

### **1. Topic / Name of the Code**

**Topic:** *Interprocess Communication (IPC) using Pipes in C*
**Name:** *Communication between processes using unnamed pipes*

---

### **2. Explanation of the Topic in Simple Words**

#### 💡 **What is a Pipe in C?**

A **pipe** is a method of **inter-process communication (IPC)** that allows **data transfer between two processes** — usually, between a parent and child process.

Think of it like a **one-way tunnel**:

* One end is for **writing**.
* The other end is for **reading**.

---

#### 🧠 **What does your code do?**

* It creates a **pipe**.
* It writes two simple messages (`"Hi"` and `"Hello"`) into the pipe.
* It then reads those messages back from the pipe.

📌 However, this code does **not use fork**, so it's actually just reading what it writes **within the same process**. It's a basic test to understand how `pipe()`, `write()`, and `read()` work.

---

### ✅ **3. Code Check & Corrections (for Kali Linux Terminal)**

Your code is **mostly correct**, but there's **one small bug**:

📌 **Line:**

```c
printf("Writing to pipe - Message 2 is %s\n", writemessages[0]);
```

You're mistakenly printing **Message 2** but showing **writemessages\[0]** instead of **writemessages\[1]**.

### ✔️ **Fixed and Clean Version for Kali Linux Terminal:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

    char readmessage[20];

    returnstatus = pipe(pipefds);

    if (returnstatus == -1) {
        printf("Unable to create pipe\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Writing to pipe - Message 1 is %s\n", writemessages[0]);
    write(pipefds[1], writemessages[0], sizeof(writemessages[0]));
    read(pipefds[0], readmessage, sizeof(readmessage));
    printf("Reading from pipe - Message 1 is %s\n", readmessage);

    printf("Writing to pipe - Message 2 is %s\n", writemessages[1]); // fixed line
    write(pipefds[1], writemessages[1], sizeof(writemessages[1]));
    read(pipefds[0], readmessage, sizeof(readmessage));

### ✅ **1. Topic / Name of the Code**

**Topic:** *Interprocess Communication (IPC) using Unnamed Pipes with `fork()` in C*
**Name:** *Parent-to-Child Communication using Pipes in Linux (C Program)*

---

### ✅ **2. Explanation in Simple Words**

#### 💡 What is Interprocess Communication (IPC)?

* IPC lets two or more **processes communicate and share data**.
* A **pipe** is one of the simplest IPC methods.
* Pipes provide a **unidirectional communication channel** (only one-way).

---

#### 📘 What does this code do?

1. A **pipe** is created using `pipe()`.
2. A **new child process** is created using `fork()`.
3. The **parent** writes two messages (`"Hi"` and `"Hello"`) into the pipe.
4. The **child** reads both messages from the pipe and prints them.

* Think of a **parent writing notes** and sending them through a **tube (pipe)**.
* The **child waits at the other end** and reads those notes one by one.

### ✅ **3. Code Check (Correctness for Kali Linux)**

Your code is **almost perfect and will run successfully** on Kali Linux.

📌 However, there are two **small improvements** to ensure clean and safe execution:

### 🔧 **Fixed and Polished Version:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int pipefds[2];
    int returnstatus;
    int pid;
    char writemessages[2][20] = {"Hi", "Hello"};
    char readmessage[20];

    returnstatus = pipe(pipefds);
    if (returnstatus == -1) {
        printf("Unable to create pipe\n");
        return 1;
    }

    pid = fork();

    if (pid == -1) {
        printf("Fork failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Child process
    if (pid == 0) {
        close(pipefds[1]); // Close write end in child
        read(pipefds[0], readmessage, sizeof(readmessage));
        printf("Child Process - Reading from pipe: Message 1 is '%s'\n", readmessage);
        read(pipefds[0], readmessage, sizeof(readmessage));
        printf("Child Process - Reading from pipe: Message 2 is '%s'\n", readmessage);
        close(pipefds[0]); // Close read end
    } else {
        close(pipefds[0]); // Close read end in parent
        printf("Parent Process - Writing to pipe: Message 1 is '%s'\n", writemessages[0]);
        write(pipefds[1], writemessages[0], sizeof(writemessages[0]));
        printf("Parent Process - Writing to pipe: Message 2 is '%s'\n", writemessages[1]);
        write(pipefds[1], writemessages[1], sizeof(writemessages[1]));
        close(pipefds[1]); // Close write end
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### 💻 **How to Compile and Run in Kali Linux**

1. Save as `ipc_pipe_fork.c`
2. Compile:

   ```bash
   gcc ipc_pipe_fork.c -o ipc_pipe_fork
   ```
3. Run:

   ```bash
   ./ipc_pipe_fork
   ```

Would you like a diagram showing how parent and child communicate through the pipe?






Here’s a detailed explanation and check of your code:

---

### ✅ **1. Topic / Name of the Code**

**Topic:** *Disk Scheduling Algorithms*
**Specific Algorithm:** *SCAN (Elevator) Disk Scheduling Algorithm*
**Name:** *Disk Scheduling using SCAN Algorithm in C*

---

### ✅ **2. Explanation in Simple Words**

#### 💡 What is Disk Scheduling?

* When multiple read/write requests are made to a hard disk, the OS needs to decide the **order** in which to service them for **better performance**.
* The goal is to **minimize the total seek time** (the time taken for the disk arm to move between tracks).

---

#### 🛗 What is the SCAN (Elevator) Algorithm?

* SCAN works like an **elevator**:

  * The disk head moves in **one direction** (say towards the end of the disk), servicing requests.
  * Once it reaches the end, it **reverses direction** and continues servicing the remaining requests.

📌 **Example:**

* Requests = `[82, 170, 43, 140, 24, 16, 190]`
* Head = 50
* Disk Size = 200
* Head goes from 50 → to end (199) → then to start (0), servicing requests along the way.

---

#### 🔄 What your program does:

1. Takes a list of track requests.
2. Sorts the list to make traversal easy.
3. Moves from current head to the end of the disk servicing requests.
4. Then goes to the beginning (track 0).
5. Then services remaining requests in the opposite direction.
6. Prints the **seek sequence** and total number of **seek operations** (distance travelled by the head).

### ✅ **3. Code Check (Is it correct for Kali Linux?)**

✅ **Yes, your code is mostly correct and will compile and run in Kali Linux.**
But here's a **small recommended fix** for best practice and readability.

### 🔧 **Fixed and Polished Version**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void scanDisk(int requests[], int n, int head, int disk_size) {
    int seek_count = 0;
    int distance, cur_track;
    int i, j;

    // Sort the requests
    for(i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for(j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if(requests[j] > requests[j + 1]) {
                int temp = requests[j];
                requests[j] = requests[j + 1];
                requests[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }

    // Find the index where current head would fit
    int index = 0;
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(head < requests[i]) {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    printf("\nSeek Sequence:\n");

    // Move towards the end
    for(i = index; i < n; i++) {
        cur_track = requests[i];
        printf("%d -> ", cur_track);
        distance = abs(cur_track - head);
        seek_count += distance;
        head = cur_track;
    }

    // Go to the end of the disk
    if (head != disk_size - 1) {
        printf("%d -> ", disk_size - 1);
        seek_count += abs((disk_size - 1) - head);
        head = disk_size - 1;
    }

    // Then go to start of the disk
    printf("0 -> ");
    seek_count += head;
    head = 0;

    // Service remaining requests in opposite direction
    for(i = 0; i < index; i++) {
        cur_track = requests[i];
        printf("%d -> ", cur_track);
        distance = abs(cur_track - head);
        seek_count += distance;
        head = cur_track;
    }

    printf("\nTotal Seek Operations = %d\n", seek_count);
}

int main() {
    int n, i, head, disk_size;

    printf("Enter number of disk requests: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int requests[n];

    printf("Enter the request sequence:\n");
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &requests[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter initial head position: ");
    scanf("%d", &head);

    printf("Enter total disk size: ");
    scanf("%d", &disk_size);

    scanDisk(requests, n, head, disk_size);

    return 0;
}
```
